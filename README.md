iOS version of the kswap app
Created by: Eunice Borres 

Project proposal:

The purpose of this project is to keep track of different inclusions when buying a kpop album, more specifically photocards. This app will allow the user to search for different groups available to the database and add it to their own collection. The database that will be used for this app is called supabase which is an open source Firebase alternative. 

Features of this app will include a login and registration system, a search system, which includes a category dropdown feature and users having the ability to add or delete photocards from their collection.
